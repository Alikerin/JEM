# JEM - Joint Energy Models

Code for the paper [Your Classifier is Secretly an Energy Based Model and You Should Treat it Like One](https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.03263).

We show that architectures traditionally used for classification can be reinterpreted as energy based models of the joint distribution over data and labels p(x, y). 

Training models in this way has many benifits including:

### Improved calibration

### Out-Of-Distribution Detection

### Adversarial Robustness

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/wgrathwohl/JEM/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
